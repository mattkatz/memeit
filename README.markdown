# Meme it #

This is a silly idea inspired by https://mastodon.social/@climagic/104478724407900816

I just want a quick way to produce more dumb jokes quickly.

# Usage

    memeit
      Add top and bottom text to a file
      Requirements: imagemagick, impact font
    
      -h - Show this help
      -t - Top Text
      -b - Bottom text
      -i - Input image
      -o - Output image
    
    
# Installation

It's a script. Just copy it somewhere into your PATH.
I put it into ~/.local/bin, but I also add that to my path using [my personal jumpstart scripts](https://github.com/mattkatz/jumpstart).
